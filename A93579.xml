            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MArke Gentle Reader, for thine owne good, and the comfort of thy ſoule, the damnable effects of Covetuouſneſſe and diſtruſt of Gods never fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling providence.</p>
            <p>This man the ſad ſubject of this little treatice was a Muſitian in <hi>Coventry,</hi> whom for his skill in his Art and profeſſion few or none could compare with him, by which he gained not onely the love of many Gentlemen thereabouts; but alſo a competent eſtate to himſelfe: God moreover to enlarge his bleſſings if grace had cauſed him ſo to thinke of it, gave him nineteene children, which the Holy Ghoſt by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth manifeſt to be great bleſſings, for ſaith he in the <hi>Pſalmes, Loe children the fruit of the wombe are a bleſsing, and an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance that comes from the Lord;</hi> But hee to the contrary thought them to be curſes, and diſtruſting Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thought that he who doth and is able to provide for all the creatures on the face of the Earth, <hi>yea and feedes the young Ravens that call upon him,</hi> was not able, or if he could, yet he would not afford meanes to maintaine and provide for thoſe children which he had given, but indeed as it is ſo it wil be an infallible truth that infidelitie &amp; miſerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,

            <p>It hath plainely appeared both by his wife and other creadible neibours, that upon the 16 of <hi>February</hi> Laſt paſt; which to their ſorrow and loſſe, ſome of them are forſt to Iuſtifie, there aroſe a mightie and tempeſtuous wind, from morning till night, by reaſon whereof ſome had their houſes blowne downe, others their reeks of come and hay ſerved in like manner, and inconclution many had loſſe and wrong, the very day this wretched man perceiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156650:3"/>his time to bee but ſhort and almoſt drawne to a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od day; too his coſt, to ſoone beeing ſpent, and night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching he repaires to his death bed, his wife with him allſo, wherein long he had not continued but he called his wife, deſiring her to fetch him Pen Incke and paper, profeſſing that he muſt not delay but forthwith make his laſt will and teſtament. His wife wondring at this his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and unexpected reſolution halfe amazed, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſed it had beene rather in jeſt then earneſt, ſhe ſeemed to procraſtinate and delay the time, but hee abſolute in his determination urged her forthwith to diſpatch, ſaying that by and by a man would come and knocke at his dore to ſpeake with him but ſaith he denie me, and ſay I am not at home, his Wife to ſulfill his deſire not knowing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or the cauſe that moued him there unto, went to fetch him thoſe things he asked for, which being no ſooner brought, but before he could make uſe of them the unwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come meſſenger he laſt ſpeake of came and knocked at his doore, I am quoth he now I doubt prevented the man is come bnfore I can diſpatch the thinge I meant to have done, but howſoever deney me if it be poſſible.</p>
            <p>Downe then went his Wife from her Huſband to the doore, unto which when ſhe came, ſhe found a man, and a handſome man as ſhe thought, who ſaid to her thus, (woeman) where is thy huſband: the woeman replyed Sir he is not now at home; Nay woeman quoth he deney him not for that is in vaine, for I know that he is now in bed, and I muſt and will ſpeake with him.</p>
            <p>The woman unwilling to with ſtand a knowne truth gave him leaue to enter the houſe, and ſhewed him where her huſband was, unto which place when he came, thir was ſtraight ſome private conference betwixt them, the woman his wife then preſent, pondering in hir mind, the cauſe of ſuch ſad and ſolatery paſſages, ſhe perceiued to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156650:4"/>be betwene them, at laſt this infernall feind after their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diſcourſe ended, changed his aſſumed ſhape and appeared to the woman what indeed he was, the woman at hir huſbands end, being almoſt driuen to hir wits end, ran downe the ſtaires to call hir neighbours about her but before ſhee or they came, the man by that murthering feind the devill, was at once robed of his life heere, and much to bedoubted of his life heareafter, and at the returne of his wife and neighboures they found this miſerable Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife dead in his bed, with his neck broken, to the terrour of the beholders, he had in his life time a Cheſt wherin he would never ſuffer neither his wife nor any child he had to looke in, which after his death was opened and found filled to the topp with Gould, as they thought, but being once touched it fell to duſt, I ſpeake not here of the number of yeares that the Devill gave him to live, becauſe to none but him ſelfe it was Knowne I might ſay ſomething of his courſe of life but that is needles, for it is eaſily underſtod that his life is abhominabl whoſe death is Damnable, ſo then, and marke whoſoever thou art that giveſt thy ſelfe to covetouſneſſe and will not the Lord to be ſuffitient for the marke alſo what it hath wrought in many others, and make them an example to thy ſelfe, I could inſtance many but I will ſpeake only of theſe as pertinent to this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the firſt is that arch traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> who becauſe he could get no more, would under value his Lord and Maſter and rather then he would goe without money, would ſell him though it were but for thirtie peeces of ſilver, a ſecond is that <hi>Ananias</hi> who through covetouſneſſe and to ſave his money would not ſticke to lie though it were againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

            <p> Another of the ſame nature we may read of <hi>Ahab</hi> who lay groaning upon his bed ſicke and would not eate bread till he had the Vinyard of <hi>Nabeth,</hi> and rather then his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould be of none effect, he would by that wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument <hi>Ieſebell</hi> his wife, cauſe him to be ſtoned to death.</p>
            <p>But what was the end of theſe covetous wretches; for the firſt, hee came and made abare confeſſion of his fault but wanting Grace went away and deſperately hanged himſelfe, another with his wife alſo which is not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, at the rebuke of one of the Apoſtles for lying againſt the holy Ghoſt was ſuddainely ſmitten deade.</p>
            <p>A third for his theft and unjuſt deſires was for the ſame ajudged to be ſtoned to death.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt for that he ſold himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe, was by the juſt decree of Almightie GOD, ſtrangely ſhot into the body as he fate in his Chariott, by which mortall wound he died.</p>
            <p>O! the folly and madneſſe of many men, who ſell their ſoules eternall happineſſe for a few temporall and fading pleaſures, but if they would conſider with me theſe two things certainly it would be a large motive to reduce men from prizing temporall things at ſo high a rate, as many now a dayes doe.</p>
            <p>O! that man would conſider the eternitie of his ſoule which becauſe it is the breath of GOD it cannot dye, but muſt live everlaſtingly in either weale or woe, now if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the body under the wrath and curſe of GOD, in what miſerable eſtate doth the body leave it; and ſo to it's coſt will one day finde it, for this is true, that as death leaves a man, ſo Iudgement will finde him. For it is an old ſaying that as the tree falls ſo it lyes, for after death Repentance is no whit prevalent, for then we ſhall repent for nothing, but this that we repented no ſooner, for ſuch will be the extremitie of paine in that lake of fire and Brimſtone wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156650:5"/>the ſoule ſhall be ſo diſtracted that it can thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but execrations, blaſphemies and the like; Now it is eternitie that ads fewell to this fire, for ſo oft as the Soule thinkes of this little word (ever) it is a Hell in the midſt of Hell, Nay it is a very Hell it ſelfe. O! the heavie doome of the juſt Iudgement of Almightie GOD, who as he hath not limited his mercies to his elect, ſo he hath not ſet or apoynted an end of puniſhment to the Reprobate, but ſo farr is their miſery from ending, that it is ever but begining, now then let thoſe damned ſoule ſelling witches Conjurers, and ſuch like, duely conſider the miſeries of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death, conſider it I ſayall you that forget GOD, leaſt ſuddainly his wrath breake out upon you and heteare you in peeces whileſt ther is none to help you, conſider alſo that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, for he is a God of pure eyes, and cannot behold innequitie with any the leaſt conſent or liking, but wil puniſh it either here or hereafter, though in his deareſt Children.</p>
            <p>But that no man ſhould deſpaire, let him know that as God is a iuſt God, ſo he is a mercifull God alſo, for his mercies are above all his workes, for let the wicked ſorſake his finne, and the uniuſt man his dealing, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto the Lord and hee will have mercy upon him, and will abundantly pardon, therefore forſake finne, and feare not but thou ſhalt finde mercy, upon which I wiſh every man to relie.</p>
